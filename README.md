# memcollection

This is a personal project aimed at databasing my entomology collection and making the data freely available and easily accessible to anyone interested in my collection.

## Dependencies

It's always best to use the latest versions, but I included the versions I'm using for each of these dependencies:
- Django (v2.2.6)
- django-filter (2.2.0)
- Python (v3.7)
- PostgreSQL (v9.4 beta 3)
- psycopg2 (v2.7.7)
- jQuery (v3.3.1)
- Bootstrap (v4.3.1)
- List.js (v1.5.0)
