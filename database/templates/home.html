    <center><h5 class="page-title">Welcome to the <strong>Megan E. McCarty Collection</strong> website!</h5></center>
    <hr>
    <p>My entomology collection contains more than 3,000 specimens, with a focus on Lepidoptera. These specimens have been collected from all over the United States, including Alaska. Currently, the website contains {{ num_specimens }} specimen records, {{ num_specimen_images }} specimen images, and {{ num_species }} species from the collection, and new records are being added frequently. In time, you'll be able to view every insect specimen in the collection, as well as its associated data.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to not only help me keep track of the specimens in my collection, but to also make this information freely available to those interested in entomology. In addition to providing data associated with my specimens, I also aim to provide information about each insect species in my collection, as well as photographs of live adults and immature stages.</p>
